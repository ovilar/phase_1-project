# My Phase 1 Project for Flatiron School
#Phase 1 Project for Flatiron School's Data Science Program

#In this project, I evaluate the performance of movies by their return on investment (locally, globally and in total)
#compared to their production costs. I also analyze how a genre of a movie can be associated with its rate of return.

#I use several databases from the Phase 1 Project proposed by Flatiron School's Data Science Program and merge them using
#SQL and Pandas DataFrames.

#Visual analysis is also provided and some appendix section, with further exploratory analysis.

#I hope you enjoy! Feel free to reach out with any suggestion and/or criticism.

#Thank you!
