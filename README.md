# My Phase 1 Project for Flatiron School
#Phase 1 Project for Flatiron School's Data Science Program

#In this project, I evaluate the performance of movies by their return on investment (locally, globally and in total)
#compared to their production costs. I also analyze how a genre of a movie can be associated with its rate of return.

#I use several databases from the Phase 1 Project proposed by Flatiron School's Data Science Program and merge them using
#SQL and Pandas DataFrames. The databases come from: IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, Box Office Mojo, The Movie Database and The Numbers Movie Database.


#The variables that are gathered range from the movie title, studio, year, runtime (minutes), production costs
#domestic gross and worldwide gross. From that, I calculate the return of investment of each movie.

#Several analysis are performed, at the studio, genre and characteristics level.

#Visual analysis is also provided and some appendix section, with further exploratory analysis.

#You will find at this repository: the jupyter notebook files, depicting all the processes run using Pandas;
#this README.md file with general instructions. Unfortunately, given file size limitations the databases 
#couldn't be uploaded to GitHub.

#You can find the slides to the presentation summing up the results at:

#I hope you enjoy! Feel free to reach out with any suggestion and/or criticism.

#LIMITATIONS: I do not analyze movies from the past and or the performance of series. Furthermore, one cool
# analysis that might be interesting is merging this information with licensing products/rights datasets.
#This would allow to check whether certain movies are able to grab a bigger piece of the revenue pie through
#other activities.

#Thank you!
